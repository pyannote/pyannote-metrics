    """Evaluation of low-latency speaker spotting (LLSS) systems

    LLSS systems can be evaluated in two ways: with fixed or variable latency.

    * When latency is fixed a priori (default), only scores reported by the
    system within the requested latency range are considered. Varying the
    detection threshold has no impact on the actual latency of the system. It
    only impacts the detection performance.

    * In variable latency mode, the whole stream of scores is considered.
    Varying the detection threshold will impact both the detection performance
    and the detection latency. Each trial will result in the alarm being
    triggered with a different latency. In case the alarm is not triggered at
    all (missed detection), the latency is arbitrarily set to the value one
    would obtain if it were triggered at the end of the last target speech
    turn. The reported latency is the average latency over all target trials.

    Parameters
    ----------
    latencies : float iterable, optional
        Switch to fixed latency mode, using provided `latencies`.
        Defaults to [1, 5, 10, 30, 60] (in seconds).
    thresholds : float iterable, optional
        Switch to variable latency mode, using provided detection `thresholds`.
        Defaults to fixed latency mode.

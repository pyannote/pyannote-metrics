"A toolkit for reproducible evaluation, diagnostic, and error analysis of speaker diarization systems"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`pyannote.metrics` is an open-source Python library aimed at researchers working in the wide area of speaker diarization. It provides a command line interface (CLI) to improve reproducibility and comparison of speaker diarization research results. Through its application programming interface (API), a large set of evaluation metrics is available for diagnostic purposes of all modules of typical speaker diarization pipelines (speech activity detection, speaker change detection, clustering, and identification). Finally, thanks to `pyannote.core` visualization capabilities, it can also be used for detailed error analysis purposes.

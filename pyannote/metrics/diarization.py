    Second DIHARD Challenge Evaluation Plan. Version 1.1
    N. Ryant, K. Church, C. Cieri, A. Cristia, J. Du, S. Ganapathy, M. Liberman
    https://coml.lscp.ens.fr/dihard/2019/second_dihard_eval_plan_v1.1.pdf

    "The Jaccard error rate is based on the Jaccard index, a similarity measure
    used to evaluate the output of image segmentation systems. An optimal
    mapping between reference and system speakers is determined and for each
    pair the Jaccard index is computed. The Jaccard error rate is then defined
    as 1 minus the average of these scores. While similar to DER, it weights
    every speakerâs contribution equally, regardless of how much speech they
    actually produced.

    More concretely, assume we have N reference speakers and M system speakers.
    An optimal mapping between speakers is determined using the Hungarian
    algorithm so that each reference speaker is paired with at most one system
    speaker and each system speaker with at most one reference speaker. Then,
    for each reference speaker ref the speaker-specific Jaccard error rate
    JERref is computed as JERref = (FA + MISS) / TOTAL where
        * TOTAL is the duration of the union of reference and system speaker
        segments; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system
        speaker, it is the duration of all reference speaker segments
        * FA is the total system speaker time not attributed to the reference
        speaker; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system speaker,
        it is 0
        * MISS is the total reference speaker time not attributed to the system
        speaker; if the reference speaker was not paired with a system speaker,
        it is equal to TOTAL

    The Jaccard error rate then is the average of the speaker specific Jaccard
    error rates.

    JER and DER are highly correlated with JER typically being higher,
    especially in recordings where one or more speakers is particularly
    dominant. Where it tends to track DER is in outliers where the diarization
    is especially bad, resulting in one or more unmapped system speakers whose
    speech is not then penalized. In these cases, where DER can easily exceed
    500%, JER will never exceed 100% and may be far lower if the reference
    speakers are handled correctly."

    Parameters
    ----------
    collar : float, optional
        Duration (in seconds) of collars removed from evaluation around
        boundaries of reference segments.
    skip_overlap : bool, optional

    ----------
    weighted : bool, optional
        When True (default), each cluster/class is weighted by its overall
        duration.
    collar : float, optional
        Duration (in seconds) of collars removed from evaluation around

    skip_overlap : bool, optional
        Set to True to not evaluate overlap regions.

    beta : float, optional
        When beta > 1, greater importance is given to coverage.
        When beta < 1, greater importance is given to purity.
        Defaults to 1.

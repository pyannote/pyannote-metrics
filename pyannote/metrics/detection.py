    """Detection error rate

    This metric can be used to evaluate binary classification tasks such as

    contain segments corresponding to the positive class (e.g. speech regions).
    Gaps in the inputs considered as the negative class (e.g. non-speech

    It is computed as (fa + miss) / total, where fa is the duration of false
    alarm (e.g. non-speech classified as speech), miss is the duration of
    missed detection (e.g. speech classified as non-speech), and total is the
    total duration of the positive class in the reference.

    collar : float, optional
        Duration (in seconds) of collars removed from evaluation around
        boundaries of reference segments (one half before, one half after).
    skip_overlap : bool, optional
        Set to True to not evaluate overlap regions.
